            We launched our first EVs back in 2016, long before they became a buzzword, with a pilot of 10 electric

                        Petrol and diesel vehicles emit CO2, which is a ‘greenhouse gas’ that causes air pollution and
                        leads to global warming. Trees, by taking in CO2 for photosynthesis, mitigate this effect.
                        However, 1 tree can digest just 22kgs of CO2 in a year!

            Solar power has vast potential in a sunny country like India. We started tapping it for our warehouse needs
            as far back as 2016, with solar panels installed on the roof of one of our Bangalore delivery
            centres.<br><br>

            Today, we have <b>4,363kWp</b> panels installed atop 28 warehouses in 9 cities. Together, these generated
            36,94,089kWp in 2021 alone, reducing our <b>CO2 emissions by 1,290 tonnes.</b> For perspective, this is the
            daily
            power consumed by 4.5 lakh+ households (8 kWh/day) in India. Many of our warehouses also <b>turned
                energy-positive, giving 3,51,807 kilowatt hours of power back to the grid in 2021.</b><br><br>

            Fruits, vegetables, dairy, meat… to keep these perishables fresh for you, we need cold rooms for storage.
            Unfortunately, conventional cooling systems not only run on fossil fuels and emit greenhouse gases but are
            also energy inefficient.<br><br>

            To find a solution, we partnered with the World Bank’s TechEmerge program that connects organisations with
            innovators. And on 1st January 2021, we installed <b>GreenCHILL, our first biomass-fueled chilling
                system</b>, in
            Bangalore, in partnership with New Leaf Dynamic Technologies.<br><br>

            When any natural plant-based material dies and decays, it releases CO2 back into the atmosphere. GreenCHILL
            uses this biomass to generate power. <b>These energy-efficient coolers use biowaste</b> such as cashew
            shells and
            coconut husk as fuel and <b>consume just 8 units/day of electricity</b> compared to the 90 units/day that a
            conventional cooling system uses. So far, we’ve established 9 GreenCHILL units, saving <b>186 tonnes of CO2
                per
                year!</b><br><br>

            Rainwater that goes uncollected is, at best, wasted, and at worst, a cause for flooding in congested cities.
            We have established rainwater harvesting systems of different capacities in 9 of our warehouses located in
            areas that receive good rainfall through the year.. On average, just 1 hour of rainfall lets us collect
            27,000 litres of water, which is sufficient to support the needs of one warehouse for over 5 days!<br>

            There is a beautiful saying in sustainability circles — real change happens not when a hundred people are
            perfectly sustainable but when a million of us attempt to be sustainable, however imperfectly. Thank you for
            always supporting us!<br><br>
            As we continue on this green journey, we promise you one thing: an unwavering commitment to move the needle
            on sustainability. We will keep trying, learning, and doing better every year.<br><br>
